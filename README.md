## motorsOperator:
The purpose of this program is to facilitate the control of the engine control module.
To do this I use here a **Motor Shield R3** as well as a **Arduino UNO R3**
In this first version of the programs, the instructions are sent by *bluetooth*, the final version will be controlled by a **Raspberry pi**  which will receive its instructions from the wifi and which will make its own decisions using the various sensors it will carry.
